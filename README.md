The Sphinx 1.0

Player clicks on each relic represented by an icon in the north, west, and south directions. A riddle will be presented and the player must choose one of the answers to earn the relic. If the answer is incorrect, however, the player loses one life. Each relic can only be won once but may be attempted to be won as long it has not been correctly answered. Once the three questions are correctly answered, the player must click on the sphinx to end the game.
